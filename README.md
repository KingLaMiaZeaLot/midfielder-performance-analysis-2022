# SÃ¼per Lig 2022-2023 Midfielder Performance Analysis

This project analyzes midfield players from the 2022-2023 SÃ¼per Lig season using key performance metrics. It evaluates overall contribution, consistency, and positional strength using normalized scoring, z-score based consistency, and clear visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Identify top-performing midfielders based on data-driven metrics
- Quantify consistency across key areas of play
- Provide visual comparisons between teams and individual players
- Highlight all-round performers and positional specialists

## ðŸ“Š Metrics Used

- **Cmp%** â€“ Pass completion percentage  
- **DribSucc%** â€“ Dribble success rate  
- **SoT%** â€“ Shots on target percentage  
- **TklW + Int** â€“ Defensive contribution (tackles won + interceptions)

## ðŸ”§ Engineered Metrics

- **Performance Score**: Normalized average of four key metrics  
- **Consistency Index**: Based on average absolute z-score across all metrics (higher = more consistent)  
- **All-Round Score**: Simple average of all raw metric values

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Manually compiled from SÃ¼per Lig midfield players across Galatasaray, FenerbahÃ§e, BeÅŸiktaÅŸ, and Trabzonspor  
- Can be extended with scraped data from sources like [fbref](https://fbref.com) or [understat](https://understat.com)
